# About
This is a desktop GUI bi-directional up-down timer for Windows. Unlike traditional timers, this timer will count both up and down allowing you to save up or earn time from various activities (e.g. work, homework) and later on spend them (e.g. watching a movie).

Initially, the timer starts in an unpaused state, counting up at a rate of 1. You can easily toggle between counting up and down with hotkeys, and you can also adjust the rate at which the timer counts. A tooltip will appear to indicate the current counting rate whenever you adjust it.
## Features
- The timer begins in the unpaused state, counting up at a rate of 1 per second
- The direction and rate of the counting can be changed using Alt + K and Alt + J
- Pause and unpause the timer with Alt + P
- The timer can go into negative time, displayed with a negative sign.
- Always stays on top of other windows for easy reference.
## Hotkeys
- Alt + K: Increase counting rate by 1
- Alt + J: Decrease counting rate by 1
- Alt + P: Pause/Unpause the timer
